1.) Create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and log in with your credentials.
    Create a new Amazon SageMaker instance by following the instructions in the 
    slideset of this week.

2.) Upload the Jupyter notebook 'convolutional_neural_network_MNIST.ipynb' to
    the Amazon SageMaker Jupyter notebook instance.

3.) Run the Jupyter notebook 'convolutional_neural_network_MNIST.ipynb'
    step by step. Although this is not part of the written exam, you should 
    understand the following concepts:
    - classification model
    - train & test samples
    - convolutional neural network (CNN)
    - model training
    - model evaluation
    - confusion matrix (metric: accuracy)
