# OOP examples with Python: Animations
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Run the Jupyter notebook 'turtle_race_OOP_example_Python.ipynb' step 
    by step and try to understand what the Python code does. In class, we will
    make a deep dive into this OOP example and discuss single code lines of this 
    animation example.

2.) Use the Turtle race example and add additional turtles. Note that, currently, 
    you must make changes the position of text and lenght of the finish-lines
    by hand, if you add additional turtles.

3.) Also look at the other OOP - example showing an animations in 'bouncing_ball_
    OOP_example_Python.ipynb'. In this example, classes are used to create objects 
    with certain attributes such as the velocity and size of bouncing balls Try to 
    change the parameters in this example and look how the results change.
