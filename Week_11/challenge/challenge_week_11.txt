# Scientific Programming Challenge Week (11)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------

Background:
Your friend is a passionate paddler and like to travel on the Swiss river Thur. 
For the Thur there are water levels available on the website of the Federal Office 
of Hydrology. Your friend asked you to collect the water level data to create a 
forecast model at a later point in time. Unfortunately there is no web API.

You choose the following setting to help your friend:
- collect the water level data by means of a web scraper (Python script) 
- use an EC2 instance to run the Python script
- schedule the Python script to collect the data at an interval of 1 minute
- store the data in a single csv file with a time stamp

Hint:
- data are available here: https://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch/de/2044.html
- first develop a web scraper (Python script) with Beautifulsoup on your local computer
- follow the steps described in task_02 of this week to run and schedule the Python script
- to store the data, use df.to_csv(...,  mode='a') which appends new data
