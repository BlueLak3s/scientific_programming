# Collect and analyse charging station data
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Run the Jupyter notebook 'data_collector.ipynb' on your local computer step 
    by step and try to understand, what the Python code does. You should understand 
    the following methods and concepts:
    - filtering files using: fnmatch.filter(os.listdir('.'), '*.json')
    - fetch data from urls using: urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
    - formatting datetimes using: datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S')
    - normalize .json files using: json_normalize()

2.) Go to the website https://www.uvek-gis.admin.ch/BFE/diemo/demo-prod.html.
    The website shows several tables. The first table includes operators of charging
    stations in Switzerland and the number of chargings stations, Electric Vehicle
    Supply Equipment (EVSE) units and the number of plugs. The last table includes
    real-time utilization data of charging stations. Compare the data in your 
    Jupyter notebook with the data in the last table of the website.

3.) Go to the website: https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=de&topic=ech&layers=ch.bfe.ladestellen-elektromobilitaet
    Click on a single changing station symbol (green or red colored) and look
    which information is provided for each Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) unit.
    Think about how you could find the chanrging station and EVSEs in your data.
    
    Hint: 
    There is a second .json file provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. 
    See: https://opendata.swiss/dataset/ladestationen-fuer-elektroautos
    Each EVSE has an ID which is provided in both files. Also look at the challenge
    and its solution of week 06.
