# OOP examples with Python: Agent-based modeling
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Run the Jupyter notebook 'agent_based_model_OOP_example_Python.ipynb' step 
    by step and try to understand what the Python code does.

3.) In this agent-based model example, we have three different classes:

    - State class
    - MyAgent class
    - InfectionModel class

    Look at how inheritance is used, for example how the MyAgent class inherits
    from the Agent class of the mesa library or how the InfectionModel class
    inherits from the Model class of the mesa library. Look at how the MultiGrid 
    class is used to define a grid space in which agents move.

2.) Change the model parameters to run your own agent-based model. Look at how 
    the results of the simulation change depending on the parameter settings.
