# Scientific Programming Challenge Week (11)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------

Background:
Your colleague is a passionate paddler and like to travel on the Swiss river Thur. 
For the Thur there are water levels available online. Your colleague asked you to 
collect the water level data to create a forecast model at a later point in time. 
Unfortunately there is no web API.

You choose the following setting to help your friend:
- collect the water level data by means of a web scraper (Python script) 
- use an EC2 instance to run the Python script
- schedule the Python script to collect the data at an interval of 1 minute
- store the data in a single .csv file with a time stamp.

Hint:
- data are available here: https://pegelalarm.at/de/river.php?river=Thur
- on the website select a station of your choice.
- first develop a web scraper (Python script) with Beautifulsoup on your local computer
- follow the steps described in task_02 of this week to run and schedule the Python script
- to store the data use df.to_csv(...,  mode='a') which appends new data
